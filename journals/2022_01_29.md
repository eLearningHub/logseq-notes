		- AWS EFS 支持 Replication 了
		- 一开始觉得很奇怪才支持这样的功能，想了想 FS 想做 replication 确实要比对象存储复杂很多

	- [Why we're migrating (many of) our servers from Linux to FreeBSD](https://it-notes.dragas.net/2022/01/24/why-were-migrating-many-of-our-servers-from-linux-to-freebsd/)
		- 我对 [[FreeBSD]] 一无所知
		- 从文章上看， [[FreeBSD]] 最起码在网络栈上是完胜 [[Linux]] 的
			- > In the real world (of my servers and load types), I sometimes experienced severe system slowdowns due to high I/O, even if the data to be processed was not read/write dependent. On FreeBSD this does not happen, and if something is blocking, it blocks THAT operation, not the rest of the system.
	- [Rust in 2022](https://www.ncameron.org/blog/rust-in-2022-2/)
		- [nrc](https://github.com/nrc) 关于 Rust 2022 的一些想法
		- #question 文章里提到的 MCP processes 是什么？
			- MCP: Major Change Proposals
			- https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/mcp.html
		- > Paradoxically, it also results (IMO) in too many features being stabilised without enough thought given to their pros and cons, or to global issues of coherence or complexity.
			- [[Rust]] 确实有海量的 features 没有被 stable。。
		- nrc 认为 Rust 已经进入到了新特性开发收益递减的阶段，所以要考虑语言发展的长期愿景，重新确定工作的优先次序，特别是应该积极控制发展的速度。
			- > Given the size and complexity of the language, I think that we are well in to the space of diminished returns on new features.
			- > I would like to see a long-term vision for the development of the language which takes into account these diminishing returns and the maturity of the language. That vision should be used to ruthlessly prioritise development work, and in particular the pace of development should be actively controlled.
		- nrc 期待的 2022 的一些重点工作
			- Async programming
				- 预计 2022 年会有一些大的突破
			- Compile times
				- > We should do something about it, whether that is specific marketing to tell a better story, or radical changes to the compilation model.
			- Cargo and build systems
				- > I think we should move to a model where Cargo is primarily a package manager which can work with external build systems (or with the 'default' Cargo build system)
				- nrc 认为需要转变 cargo 的定位，将 cargo 变成一个能跟其他构建系统一起工作的包管理工具
			- The crate model, a versioned std, and versioned tools
				- > I would like to see Cargo support multi-crate packages.
				- 版本化的 std!
					- > I would like to see std more like a versioned crate to allow more evolution and fine-grained use of std.
			- Debugging
				- > Can we do better than the dbg macro? Can we integrate better with testing? Could we build other tools like the Tokio console to help debug programs? A language-specific debugger?
