- [Dare to ask for more #rust2024](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps//blog/2022/02/09/dare-to-ask-for-more-rust2024/) #read
	- 来自 [[nikomatsakis]] 的长文，畅想了 Rust 2024 的未来 (next edition)
		- > I believe that there is room for Rust to be 22x more productive3 and easy to use than it is today, and I think we can do it without meaningfully sacrificing reliability, performance, or versatility.
	- 文章主要聊了这么几个方面
		- a more ergonomic, expressive Rust
			- 简化，让 Rust 编译器能够接受更多实际上能工作的代码
			- 打磨，让 Rust 给出更有效更友好的提示，让新手不用盲目的增加 `&`，`*` 和 lifetime
		- a more ergonomic, expressive `async` Rust
			- 这个之前已经聊过很多了，async rust 有很多急需改进的地方
			- 从 GAT 到 Impl trait in type aliases，这些变化会让整个 Rust 生态受益而不仅仅是 async rust
			- 未来 async rust 需要想着更简单更易用的方向演进
				- 给函数加上一个 `async`，everything works
		- a more ergonomic, expressive `unsafe` Rust
			- unsafe 是 Rust 的重要组成部分，但是现在开发 unsafe 的代码体验非常糟糕
			- > We need to be sure that people can write unsafe Rust abstractions that are correct.
		- a richer, more interactive experience from Rust’s tooling
			- 更完善，更好用的工具，比如 `cargo test --debug`，能够交互式地定位问题
		- richer tooling for unsafe Rust
			- 回到 unsafe 的话题，unsafe 开发需要更多关注
	- > My hope is that for RustConf 2024, people will be bragging to each other about the hardships they endured back in the day. “Oh yeah,” they’ll say, “I was writing async Rust back in the old days. You had to grab a random crate from crates.io for every little thing you want to do. You want to use an async fn in a trait? Get a crate. You want to write an iterator that can await? Get a crate. People would come to standup after 5 days of hacking and be like ‘I finally got the code to compile!’ And we walked to work uphill in the snow! Both ways! In the summer!”
