	- syscall 开销很大，如果每次 syscall 都只 read 几个 byte，那性能肯定就上不来
	- Buffered IO 的意义在于每次 fill_buf 的时候都会读一大块数据上来(比如 8k），就能避免 syscall 的开销

	- 我们都知道 Arc 有开销，但是开销到底有多大？这个研究给出了一个量化的答案

	- > 好的设计往往不是对一个问题提出性能最高的解决方案，而是一个好的抽象层：我们可以在上面实现各种可能，而且能够把整个体系的复杂性保持了可维护的量级。

	- To Customers
		- 第一条：Keep your customers happy，满足用户的需求是第一位的
		- 后面还聊了一些公司内部的沟通技巧，直接上门问需求是最直接的
			- 更加根本的做法是读他们的代码，看他们是怎么用的
			- 开发 lib 的时候可以用到这样的技巧
	- To Project Management
		- > A road-map is a means, not an end.
		- >  Keep track of how long similar features took in other projects in your space and use this as evidence for task difficulty estimates (e.g., “feature X took three years in system Y; it’s not a one-half job for one IC.”).
	- To Design
		- 对 API 保守，对实现自由
		- 大版本变更时提供迁移工具
		- > Design as a team; implement as individuals.
		- > Late-bind to designs: encourage the team to think about the entire design space without committing to a particular point solution.
			- 在一定的时候回头重新考虑整体的设计
		- > once design is done, any IC should be able to write the code.
		- 合理的抽象
			- 太少了会变成一个大单体
			- 太多了会增加维护和理解的复杂度
	- To Code Review
		- > Create a culture where ICs feel comfortable throwing away code if it’s not the right solution
			- 不要满足于 "oh well, let’s land it and then fix it later"
	- To Strategy
		- > Do not compete on raw performance or efficiency with other teams
		- >  If someone objectively has a better system for your use case and wants to take it on, go find something else to do.
	- To Observability
		- > Measurement is a means, not an end.
		- > You should be able to detect problems in your service before your customer does.
		- > Anything that can’t be measured easily (e.g., consistency) is often forgotten; pay particular attention to attributes that are difficult to measure.
	- To Research
		- > Keep track of research in your space.
		- > Try new things.
		- > Write papers.

	- 作者提议增加一个新的 unchecked keyword
		- ```rust
		  impl Overdraft {
		      /// Check the available balance and limit, only withdrawing when they are fine
		      pub fn withdraw(&mut self, howmuch: u64) -> Result<(), ()> {
		          if self.available >= howmuch && self.limit <= howmuch {
