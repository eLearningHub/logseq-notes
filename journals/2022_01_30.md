	- [@nikomatsakis](https://github.com/nikomatsakis) 认为 Async Cancellation 跟 Panic 有相似之处
	- > In Rust, our cancellation story is centered around dropping. The idea is that to cancel a future, you drop it. Whenever you drop any kind of value in Rust, the value’s destructor runs which has the job of disposing of whatever resources that value owns.
	- > In effect, if you look at things from the “inside view” of the async fn, cancellation looks like the await call panicking – it unwinds the stack, running the destructors for all values.
	- 他的下一篇文章将会研究 Async Cancellation 的实例，尝试指出它是如何使用的，以及它为什么会比 panic 引起更多问题。
