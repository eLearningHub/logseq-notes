- > All databases are implemented on top of [ipfs-log](https://github.com/orbitdb/ipfs-log), an immutable, operation-based conflict-free replicated data structure (CRDT) for distributed systems.
- > Every entry in the log is saved in IPFS and each points to a hash of previous entry(ies) forming a graph. Logs can be forked and joined back together.
